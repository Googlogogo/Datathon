## Rules

1. All presentation material must be uploaded on the Heart Disease repository. 
2. This repository will not count towards the score.
3. Teams must ensure that the code on their repository can verify their submission (i.e. can be run and matches the teamâ€™s Kaggle submission(s)).
2. At any point during the Datathon, DS3 reserves the right to:
    1. Request a code review. 
    2. Verify that the code snippets adhere to the rules outlines in Resources & Collaboration.
    3. Run the model and compare submissions.
